## Technologies

The Portfolio Selection Tool is written in Python and uses the [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/index.html) dashboarding solution to present information to the user. 

Visualizations are provided by the [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) libraries. 

Details on asset performance are retrieved using the [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets) API.

The [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) library is used to work with the asset data retrieved from the API.

The left-hand portion of the dashboard consists of a six-question risk tolerance questionnaire. Once the questions are answered and the submit button is clicked the a risk tolerance score will be calculated for the user and they will be assigned a risk tolerance category. 

Once determined, the risk tolerance category is used to assign the user to one of four predetermined portfolios that vary in their overall level of investment risk. Details on the assigned portfolio are provided in the tabs found in the right-hand portion of the dashboard.  The following information will presented to the user:
